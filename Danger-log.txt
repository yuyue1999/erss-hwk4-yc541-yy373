Danger log
1.Database Error: Started non-transaction while transaction<READ COMMITTED> still active. How to solve: when work and non-transaction are in the same chunk, we use try to hold the non-transaction, when the code run out of the try chunk, the non-transaction will call its destructor.
2. Database Error: Started transaction while transaction<READ COMMITTED> still active. How to solve: When we connect with the SQL, we should disconnect it before the accept. And reconnect in each thread, then disconnect when the thread is going to end.
3.For database operation, sometimes I forget to execute the previous query and move on to the next one, and wrong behavior occurs. So, it is important to remember to execute the command wrote.
4. For database operation, the sstream is used to hold the database command. It is important not to forget to clear the stringstream (str(""))before moving on to the next one.
5. For each cancel, the cancel id should be the same as account id, but the query id could be not same as the account id.
6. If the amount of buy order is more than the amount of sell order in the database, we should change the status of a part of buy order to executed and insert a new buy order with the rest of the amount. The sell order is with the same situation.
